Some code and connfig for testing weewx using a driver that fetches weather data
from an internet weather API. More realistic than the Simulator.

See docs "serverinrichting" how these files are installed.

In general: weewx is installed from from /opt/weewx into /opt/weewx/weewxinst
Modifications are done by symlinking the files below into their dirs in
/opt/weewx/weewxinst. This way the installation can be quickly updated by just checking
in into GitHub.
