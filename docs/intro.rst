About this Dcoument
===================

This document is written in `Restructured Text (rst) <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
generated by `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html>`_ and hosted by `ReadTheDocs.org (RTD) <http://ReadTheDocs.org>`_.

The sources
of this document are (.rst) text files maintained in the Project's GitHub: https://github.com/Geonovum/sospilot/docs

You can also download a `PDF version of this document <https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/sospilot/latest/sospilot.pdf>`_
and even an `Ebook version <https://media.readthedocs.org/epub/sospilot/latest/sospilot.epub>`_.

This document is automatically generated whenever a commit is performed on the
above GitHub repository (via a "Post-Commit-Hook")

Using Sphinx with RTD one effectively has a living document like a Wiki
but with the structure and versioning characteristics of a real document or book.

Basically we let "The Cloud" (GitHub and RTD) work for us!
