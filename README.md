Sensor Observation Service (SOS) and data management for Air Quality data from RIVM The Netherlands.
In this project Air Quality data provided by Het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM)
is harvested and converted for further dispatching via the OGC SOS INSPIRE-enabled web-service and
other standards like WMS/WFS and E-reporting for Shared Environmental Information System (SEISs) like
the EU Shared Environmental Information System for reporting ambient air quality (2011/850/EU). 

In september 2015 support for Air Quality data from the Smart Emission project
(See http://www.ru.nl/gpm/onderzoek/research-projects/smart-emission/) was added.
